program doesn't use any (or only some) RST commands or interrupts. RST
commands are 1-byte opcodes that work similar to CALL opcodes, except
that the destination address is fixed. Since they are only 1 byte large,
they are also slightly faster.</p> <h2 id="cartridge-header-in-first-rom-bank"><a href="#cartridge-header-in-first-rom-bank" class="header-anchor">#</a> Cartridge Header in first ROM bank</h2> <p>The memory at 0100-014F contains the <a href="#the-cartridge-header">cartridge
header</a>. This area contains information
about the program, its entry point, checksums, information about the
used MBC chip, the ROM and RAM sizes, etc. Most of the bytes in this
area are required to be specified correctly.</p> <h2 id="external-memory-and-hardware"><a href="#external-memory-and-hardware" class="header-anchor">#</a> External Memory and Hardware</h2> <p>The areas from 0000-7FFF and A000-BFFF address external hardware on
the cartridge, which is essentially an expansion board.  Typically this
is a ROM and SRAM or, more often, a <a href="#memory-bank-controllers">Memory Bank Controller
(MBC)</a>. The RAM area can be read
from and written to normally; writes to the ROM area control the MBC.
Some MBCs allow mapping of other hardware into the RAM area in this
way.</p> <p>Cartridge RAM is often battery buffered to hold saved game positions,
high score tables, and other information when the Game Boy is turned
off.  For specific information read the chapter about Memory Bank
Controllers.</p> <h2 id="echo-ram"><a href="#echo-ram" class="header-anchor">#</a> Echo RAM</h2> <p>The range E000-FDFF is mapped to WRAM, but only the lower 13 bits of
the address lines are connected, with the upper bits on the upper bank
set internally in the memory controller by a bank swap register.  This
causes the address to effectively wrap around.  All reads and writes to
this range have the same effect as reads and writes to C000-DDFF.</p> <p>Nintendo prohibits developers from using this memory range.  The
behavior is confirmed on all official hardware. Some emulators (such as
VisualBoyAdvance &lt;1.8) don't emulate Echo RAM.  In some flash cartridges,
echo RAM interferes with SRAM normally at A000-BFFF. Software can check if
Echo RAM is properly emulated by writing to RAM (avoid values 00 and
FF) and checking if said value is mirrored in Echo RAM and not cart SRAM.</p> <h2 id="i-o-ranges"><a href="#i-o-ranges" class="header-anchor">#</a> I/O Ranges</h2> <p>The Game Boy uses the following I/O ranges:</p> <table><thead><tr><th><strong>Start</strong></th> <th><strong>End</strong></th> <th><strong>Revision</strong></th> <th><strong>Purpose</strong></th></tr></thead> <tbody><tr><td>$FF00</td> <td></td> <td>DMG</td> <td>Controller</td></tr> <tr><td>$FF01</td> <td>$FF02</td> <td>DMG</td> <td>Communication</td></tr> <tr><td>$FF04</td> <td>$FF07</td> <td>DMG</td> <td>Divider and Timer</td></tr> <tr><td>$FF10</td> <td>$FF26</td> <td>DMG</td> <td>Sound</td></tr> <tr><td>$FF30</td> <td>$FF3F</td> <td>DMG</td> <td>Waveform RAM</td></tr> <tr><td>$FF40</td> <td>$FF4B</td> <td>DMG</td> <td>LCD</td></tr> <tr><td>$FF4F</td> <td></td> <td>CGB</td> <td>VRAM Bank Select</td></tr> <tr><td>$FF50</td> <td></td> <td>DMG</td> <td>Set to non-zero to disable boot ROM</td></tr> <tr><td>$FF51</td> <td>$FF55</td> <td>CGB</td> <td>HDMA</td></tr> <tr><td>$FF68</td> <td>$FF69</td> <td>CGB</td> <td>BCP/OCP</td></tr> <tr><td>$FF70</td> <td></td> <td>CGB</td> <td>WRAM Bank Select</td></tr></tbody></table> <h2 id="fea0-feff-range"><a href="#fea0-feff-range" class="header-anchor">#</a> FEA0-FEFF range</h2> <p>Nintendo indicates use of this area is prohibited.  This area returns
FF when OAM is blocked, and otherwise the behavior depends on the
hardware revision.</p> <p>On DMG, MGB, SGB, and SGB2, reads during OAM block trigger the sprite
bug. Reads otherwise return 00.</p> <p>On CGB revisions 0-D, this area is a unique RAM area, but is masked
with a revision-specific value.</p> <p>On CGB revision E, AGB, AGS, and GBP, it returns the high nibble of the
lower address byte twice, e.g. FFAx returns AA, FFBx returns BB, and so
forth.</p> <h1 id="video-display"><a href="#video-display" class="header-anchor">#</a> Video Display</h1> <h2 id="overview"><a href="#overview" class="header-anchor">#</a> Overview</h2> <p>The Game Boy outputs to a 160x144 pixel LCD, using a quite complex
mechanism to facilitate rendering.</p> <div class="custom-block warning"><p class="custom-block-title">WARNING</p> <p>Sprites/graphics terminology can vary a lot among different platforms, consoles,
users and communities. You may be familiar with slightly different definitions.
Keep also in mind that some of the definitions refers to lower (hardware) tools
and some others to higher abstractions concepts.</p></div> <h3 id="tiles"><a href="#tiles" class="header-anchor">#</a> Tiles</h3> <p>Similarly to other retro systems, pixels are not manipulated
individually, as this would be expensive CPU-wise. Instead, pixels are grouped
in 8x8 squares, called <em>tiles</em> (or sometimes &quot;patterns&quot;), often considered as
the base unit in Game Boy graphics.</p> <p>A tile does not encode color information. Instead, a tile assigns a
<em>color ID</em> to each of its pixels, ranging from 0 to 3. For this reason,
Game Boy graphics are also called <em>2bpp</em> (2 bits per pixel). When a tile is used
in Background or Window, these color IDs are associated with a <em>palette</em>. When
a tile is used in a OBJ, the IDs 1 to 3 are associated with a palette, but
ID 0 means transparent.</p> <h3 id="palettes"><a href="#palettes" class="header-anchor">#</a> Palettes</h3> <p>A palette consists in a array of colors, 4 in the Game Boy's case.
Palettes are stored differently in monochrome and color versions of the console.
When applied to a tile, each color ID is used as an index to select the color
in the palette array, which then gets sent to the LCD.</p> <p>Modifying palettes enables graphical effects such as quickly flashing some graphics (damage,
invulnerability, thunderstorm, etc.), fading the screen, &quot;palette swaps&quot;, and more.</p> <h3 id="layers"><a href="#layers" class="header-anchor">#</a> Layers</h3> <p>The Game Boy has three &quot;layers&quot;, from bottom to top: the background, the window,
and the sprites. Some features and behaviors break this abstraction,
but it works for the most part.</p> <h4 id="background"><a href="#background" class="header-anchor">#</a> Background</h4> <p>The background is composed of a <em>tilemap</em>. A tilemap is a
large grid of tiles. However, tiles aren't directly written to tilemaps,
they merely contain references to the tiles.
This makes reusing tiles very cheap, both in CPU time and in
required memory space, and it is the main mechanism that helps working around the
paltry 8 KiB of video RAM.</p> <p>The background can be made to scroll as a whole, writing to two
hardware registers. This makes scrolling very cheap.</p> <h4 id="window"><a href="#window" class="header-anchor">#</a> Window</h4> <p>The window is sort of a second background layer on top of the background.
It is fairly limited: it has no transparency, it's always a
rectangle and only the position of the top-left pixel can be controlled.</p> <p>Possible usage include a fixed status bar in an otherwise scrolling game (e.g.
<em>Super Mario Bros. 3</em>).</p> <h4 id="objects"><a href="#objects" class="header-anchor">#</a> Objects</h4> <p>The background layer is useful for elements scrolling as a whole, but
it's impractical for objects that need to move separately, such as the player.</p> <p>The <em>objects</em> layer is designed to fill this gap: it allows displaying tiles anywhere
on the screen.</p> <p><em>Objects</em> are made of 1 or 2 stacked tiles (8x8 or 8x16 pixels).</p> <div class="custom-block tip"><p class="custom-block-title">NOTE</p> <p>Several objects can be combined (they can be called <em>metasprites</em>) to draw
a larger graphical element, usually called &quot;sprite&quot;. Originally, the term &quot;sprites&quot;
referred to fixed-sized objects composited together, by hardware, with a background.
Use of the term has since become more general.</p></div> <p>To summarise:</p> <ul><li><strong>Tile</strong>, an 8x8-pixel chunk of graphics.</li> <li><strong>Object</strong>, an entry in object attribute memory, composed of 1 or 2
tiles. Independent from the background.</li></ul> <h2 id="ff40-lcd-control-register"><a href="#ff40-lcd-control-register" class="header-anchor">#</a> FF40 - LCD Control Register</h2> <p><strong>LCDC</strong> is the main <strong>LCD C</strong>ontrol register. Its bits toggle what

adding dots to mode 3's duration. It routinely takes a 6 to 11 dot
break to fetch sprite patterns between background tile pattern fetches.
On DMG and GBC in DMG mode, mid-scanline writes to <code>BGP</code> allow observing
this behavior, as a sprite delay shifts the effect of a write to the
left by that many dots.</p> <p>Three things are known to pause the dot clock:</p> <ul><li>Background scrolling: If <code>SCX mod 8</code> is not zero at the start of the scanline, rendering is paused for that many dots while the shifter discards that many pixels from the leftmost tile.</li> <li>Window: An active window pauses for at least 6 dots, as the background fetching mechanism starts over at the left side of the window.</li> <li>Sprites: Each sprite usually pauses for <code>11 - min(5, (x + SCX) mod 8)</code> dots. Because sprite fetch waits for background fetch to finish, a sprite's cost depends on its position relative to the left side of the background tile under it. It's greater if a sprite is directly aligned over the background tile, less if the sprite is to the right. If the sprite's left side is over the window, use <code>255 - WX</code> for <code>SCX</code> in this formula.</li></ul> <div class="custom-block warning"><p class="custom-block-title">TO BE VERIFIED</p> <p>The exact pause duration for window start is
not confirmed; it may have the same background fetch finish delay as a
sprite. If two sprites' left sides are over the same background or
window tile, the second may pause for fewer dots.</p></div> <p>A hardware quirk in the monochrome Game Boy makes the LCD interrupt
sometimes trigger when writing to STAT (including writing $00) during
OAM scan, H-Blank, V-Blank, or LY=LYC. It behaves as if $FF were
written for one cycle, and then the written value were written the next
cycle. Because the GBC in DMG mode does not have this quirk, two games
that depend on this quirk (Ocean's <em>Road Rash</em> and Vic Tokai's <em>Xerd
no Densetsu</em>) will not run on a GBC.</p> <h2 id="lcd-interrupts"><a href="#lcd-interrupts" class="header-anchor">#</a> LCD Interrupts</h2> <h4 id="int-40-v-blank-interrupt"><a href="#int-40-v-blank-interrupt" class="header-anchor">#</a> INT 40 - V-Blank Interrupt</h4> <p>The V-Blank interrupt occurs ca. 59.7 times a second on a handheld Game
Boy (DMG or CGB) or Game Boy Player and ca. 61.1 times a second on a
Super Game Boy (SGB). This interrupt occurs at the beginning of the
V-Blank period (LY=144). During this period video hardware is not using
VRAM so it may be freely accessed. This period lasts approximately 1.1
milliseconds.</p> <h4 id="int-48-stat-interrupt"><a href="#int-48-stat-interrupt" class="header-anchor">#</a> INT 48 - STAT Interrupt</h4> <p>There are various reasons for this interrupt to occur as described by
the STAT register ($FF41). One very popular reason is to indicate to
the user when the video hardware is about to redraw a given LCD line.
This can be useful for dynamically controlling the SCX/SCY registers
($FF43/$FF42) to perform special video effects.</p> <p>Example application: set LYC to WY, enable LY=LYC interrupt, and have
the handler disable sprites. This can be used if you use the window for
a text box (at the bottom of the screen), and you want sprites to be
hidden by the text box.</p> <div class="custom-block warning"><p class="custom-block-title">WARNING</p> <p>As mentioned in the description of the STAT register, the LCD Controller cycles

different appearance on CGB displays as on VGA/HDMI monitors calibrated
to sRGB color. Because the GBC is not lit, the highest intensity will
produce Light Gray color rather than White. The intensities are not
linear; the values 10h-1Fh will all appear very bright, while medium and
darker colors are ranged at 00h-0Fh.</p> <p>The CGB display's pigments aren't perfectly saturated. This means the
colors mix quite oddly; increasing intensity of only one R,G,B color
will also influence the other two R,G,B colors. For example, a color
setting of 03EFh (Blue=0, Green=1Fh, Red=0Fh) will appear as Neon Green
on VGA displays, but on the CGB it'll produce a decently washed out
Yellow. See image on the right.</p> <h4 id="rgb-translation-by-gbas"><a href="#rgb-translation-by-gbas" class="header-anchor">#</a> RGB Translation by GBAs</h4> <p>Even though GBA is described to be compatible to CGB games, most CGB
games are completely unplayable on older GBAs because most colors are
invisible (black). Of course, colors such like Black and White will
appear the same on both CGB and GBA, but medium intensities are arranged
completely different. Intensities in range 00h..07h are invisible/black
(unless eventually under best sunlight circumstances, and when gazing at
the screen under obscure viewing angles), unfortunately, these
intensities are regularly used by most existing CGB games for medium and
darker colors.</p> <p>Newer CGB games may avoid this effect by changing palette data when

or 76 microseconds in CGB Double Speed Mode. On DMG, during this time,
the CPU can access only HRAM (memory at FF80-FFFE); on CGB, the bus used
by the source area cannot be used (this isn't understood well at the
moment, it's recommended to assume same behavior as DMG). For this
reason, the programmer must copy a short procedure into HRAM, and use
this procedure to start the transfer from inside HRAM, and wait until
the transfer has finished:</p> <div class="language- extra-class"><pre class="language-text"><code> run_dma:

shades. Tiles can be displayed as part of the Background/Window map,

method may differ. The &quot;8000 method&quot; uses $8000 as its base pointer
and uses an unsigned addressing, meaning that tiles 0-127 are in block
0, and tiles 128-255 are in block 1. The &quot;8800 method&quot; uses $9000 as
its base pointer and uses a signed addressing, meaning that tiles 0-127
are in block 2, and tiles -128 to -1 are in block 1, or to put it differently,
&quot;8800 addressing&quot; takes tiles 0-127 from block 2
and tiles 128-255 from block 1. (You can notice that block 1 is shared
by both addressing methods)</p> <p>Sprites always use 8000 addressing, but the BG and Window can use either

color numbers for each pixel, and the second byte defines the upper bits
of the color numbers. In either case, Bit 7 is the leftmost pixel, and
Bit 0 the rightmost. For example: let's say you have $57 $36 (in
this order in memory), which in binary are %01010111 and %00110110.
To obtain the color index for the leftmost pixel,
you take bit 7 of both bytes: 0, and 0. Thus the index is %00 = 0. For
the second pixel, repeat with bit 6: 1, and 0. Thus the index is %01 =
1 (remember to flip the order of the bits!). If you repeat the
operation you'll find that the indexes for the 8 pixels are 0 1 2 3 0 3
3 1.</p> <p>A more visual explanation can be found

To keep unused sprites from affecting onscreen sprites, set their Y
coordinate to Y = 0 or Y &gt;= 160 (144 + 16) (Note: Y &lt;= 8 also works

during mode 3 (pixel transfer).</p> <p>Each pixel in the FIFO has four properties:</p> <ul><li>Color: a value between 0 and 3</li> <li>Palette: on CGB a value between 0 and 7 and on DMG this only applies to sprites</li> <li>Sprite Priority: on CGB this is the OAM index for the sprite and on DMG this doesn't exist</li> <li>Background Priority: holds the value of the <a href="#vram-sprite-attribute-table-oam">OBJ-to-BG Priority</a> bit</li></ul> <h3 id="fifo-pixel-fetcher"><a href="#fifo-pixel-fetcher" class="header-anchor">#</a> FIFO Pixel Fetcher</h3> <p>The fetcher fetches a row of 8 background or window pixels and queues
them up to be mixed with sprite pixels. The pixel fetcher has 5 steps.
The first four steps take 2 cycles each and the fifth step is attempted
every cycle until it succeeds. The order of the steps are as follows:</p> <ul><li>Get tile</li> <li>Get tile data low</li> <li>Get tile data high</li> <li>Sleep</li> <li>Push</li></ul> <h4 id="get-tile"><a href="#get-tile" class="header-anchor">#</a> Get Tile</h4> <p>This step determines which background/window tile to fetch pixels from.
By default the tilemap used is the one at $9800 but certain conditions
can change that.</p> <p>When LCDC.3 is enabled and the X coordinate of the current scanline is
not inside the window then tilemap $9C00 is used.</p> <p>When LCDC.6 is enabled and the X coordinate of the current scanline is
inside the window then tilemap $9C00 is used.</p> <p>The fetcher keeps track of which X and Y coordinate of the tile it's on:</p> <p>If the current tile is a window tile, the X coordinate for the window
tile is used, otherwise the following formula is used to calculate
the X coordinate: ((SCX / 8) + fetcher's X coordinate) &amp; $1F. Because of
this formula, fetcherX can be between 0 and 31.</p> <p>If the current tile is a window tile, the Y coordinate for the window
tile is used, otherwise the following formula is used to calculate
the Y coordinate: (currentScanline + SCY) &amp; 255. Because of this formula,
fetcherY can be between 0 and 159.</p> <p>The fetcher's X and Y coordinate can then be used to get the tile from
VRAM. However, if the PPU's access to VRAM is <a href="#vram-access">blocked</a>
then the value for the tile is read as $FF.</p> <p>CGB can access both tile index and the attributes in the same clock
cycle.</p> <h4 id="get-tile-data-low"><a href="#get-tile-data-low" class="header-anchor">#</a> Get Tile Data Low</h4> <p>Check LCDC.4 for which tilemap to use. At this step CGB also needs to
check which VRAM bank to use and check if the tile is flipped vertically.
Once the tilemap, VRAM and vertical flip is calculated the tile data
is retrieved from VRAM. However, if the PPU's access to VRAM is
<a href="#vram-access">blocked</a> then the tile data is read as $FF.</p> <p>The tile data retrieved in this step will be used in the push steps.</p> <h4 id="get-tile-data-high"><a href="#get-tile-data-high" class="header-anchor">#</a> Get Tile Data High</h4> <p>Same as Get Tile Data Low except the tile address is incremented by 1.</p> <p>The tile data retrieved in this step will be used in the push steps.</p> <p>This also pushes a row of background/window pixels to the FIFO. This
extra push is not part of the 8 steps, meaning there's 3 total chances to
push pixels to the background FIFO every time the complete fetcher steps
are performed.</p> <h4 id="push"><a href="#push" class="header-anchor">#</a> Push</h4> <p>Pushes a row of background/window pixels to the FIFO. Since tiles are 8
pixels wide, a &quot;row&quot; of pixels is 8 pixels from the tile to be rendered
based on the X and Y coordinates calculated in the previous steps.</p> <p>Pixels are only pushed to the background FIFO if it's empty.</p> <p>This is where the tile data retrieved in the two Tile Data steps will
come in handy. Depending on if the tile is flipped horizontally the
pixels will be pushed to the background FIFO differently. If the tile
is flipped horizontally the pixels will be pushed LSB first. Otherwise
they will be pushed MSB first.</p> <h4 id="sleep"><a href="#sleep" class="header-anchor">#</a> Sleep</h4> <p>Do nothing.</p> <h4 id="vram-access"><a href="#vram-access" class="header-anchor">#</a> VRAM Access</h4> <p>At various times during PPU operation read access to VRAM is blocked and
the value read is $FF:</p> <ul><li>LCD turning off</li> <li>At scanline 0 on CGB when not in double speed mode</li> <li>When switching from mode 3 to mode 0</li> <li>On CGB when searching OAM and index 37 is reached</li></ul> <p>At various times during PPU operation read access to VRAM is restored:</p> <ul><li>At scanline 0 on DMG and CGB when in double speed mode</li> <li>On DMG when searching OAM and index 37 is reached</li> <li>After switching from mode 2 (oam search) to mode 3 (pixel transfer)</li></ul> <p>NOTE: These conditions are checked only when entering STOP mode and the
PPU's access to VRAM is always restored upon leaving STOP mode.</p> <h3 id="mode-3-operation"><a href="#mode-3-operation" class="header-anchor">#</a> Mode 3 Operation</h3> <p>As stated before the pixel FIFO only operates during mode 3 (pixel
transfer). At the beginning of mode 3 both the background and OAM FIFOs
are cleared.</p> <h4 id="the-window-2"><a href="#the-window-2" class="header-anchor">#</a> The Window</h4> <p>When rendering the window the background FIFO is cleared and the fetcher
is reset to step 1. When WX is 0 and the SCX &amp; 7 &gt; 0 mode 3 is shortened
by 1 cycle.</p> <p>When the window has already started rendering there is a bug that occurs
when WX is changed mid-scanline. When the value of WX changes after the
window has started rendering and the new value of WX is reached again,
a pixel with color value of 0 and the lowest priority is pushed onto the
background FIFO.</p> <h4 id="sprites"><a href="#sprites" class="header-anchor">#</a> Sprites</h4> <p>The following is performed for each sprite on the current scanline if
LCDC.1 is enabled (this condition is ignored on CGB) and the X coordinate
of the current scanline has a sprite on it. If those conditions are not
met then sprite fetching is <a href="#sprite-fetch-abortion">aborted</a>.</p> <p>At this point the <a href="#fifo-pixel-fetcher">fetcher</a> is advanced one step
until it's at step 5 or until the background FIFO is not empty. Advancing
the fetcher one step here lengthens mode 3 by 1 cycle. This process may
be <a href="#sprite-fetch-abortion">aborted</a> after the fetcher has advanced a
step.</p> <p>When SCX &amp; 7 &gt; 0 and there is a sprite at X coordinate 0 of the current
scanline then mode 3 is lengthened. The amount of cycles this lengthens
mode 3 by is whatever the lower 3 bits of SCX are. After this penalty is
applied object fetching may be aborted. Note that the timing of the
penalty is not confirmed. It may happen before or after waiting for the
fetcher. More research needs to be done.</p> <p>After checking for sprites at X coordinate 0 the fetcher is advanced two
steps. The first advancement lengthens mode 3 by 1 cycle and the second
advancement lengthens mode 3 by 3 cycles. After each fetcher advancement
there is a chance for a sprite fetch abortion to occur.</p> <p>The lower address for the row of pixels of the target object tile is now
retrieved and lengthens mode 3 by 1 cycle. Once the address is retrieved
this is the last chance for sprite fetch abortion to occur. Exiting
object fetch lengthens mode 3 by 1 cycle. The upper address for the
target object tile is now retrieved and does not shorten mode 3.</p> <p>At this point <a href="#vram-access">VRAM Access</a> is checked for the lower and
upper addresses for the target object. Before any mixing is done, if the
OAM FIFO doesn't have at least 8 pixels in it then transparent pixels
with the lowest priority are pushed onto the OAM FIFO. Once this is done
each pixel of the target object row is checked. On CGB, horizontal flip
is checked here. If the target object pixel is not white and the pixel in
the OAM FIFO <em>is</em> white, or if the pixel in the OAM FIFO has higher
priority than the target object's pixel, then the pixel in the OAM FIFO
is replaced with the target object's properties.</p> <p>Now it's time to <a href="#pixel-rendering">render a pixel</a>! The same process
described in Sprite Fetch Abortion is performed: a pixel is rendered and
the fetcher is advanced one step. This advancement lengthens mode 3 by 1
cycle if the X coordinate of the current scanline is not 160. If the X
coordinate is 160 the PPU stops processing sprites (because they won't be
visible).</p> <p>Everything in this section is repeated for every sprite on the current
scanline unless it was decided that fetching should be aborted or the
X coordinate is 160.</p> <h4 id="pixel-rendering"><a href="#pixel-rendering" class="header-anchor">#</a> Pixel Rendering</h4> <p>This is where the background FIFO and OAM FIFO are mixed. There are
conditions where either a background pixel or a sprite pixel will have
display priority.</p> <p>If there are pixels in the background and OAM FIFOs then a pixel is
popped off each. If the OAM pixel is not transparent and LCDC.1 is
enabled then the OAM pixel's background priority property is used if it's
the same or higher priority as the background pixel's background priority.</p> <p>Pixels won't be pushed to the LCD if there is nothing in the background
FIFO or the current pixel is pixel 160 or greater.</p> <p>If LCDC.0 is disabled then the background is disabled on DMG and the
background pixel won't have priority on CGB. When the background pixel
is disabled the pixel color value will be 0, otherwise the color value
will be whatever color pixel was popped off the background FIFO. When the
pixel popped off the background FIFO has a color value other than 0 and
it has priority then the sprite pixel will be discarded.</p> <p>At this point, on DMG, the color of the pixel is retrieved from the BGP
register and pushed to the LCD. On CGB when <a href="#cgb-palette-access">palette access</a>
is blocked a black pixel is pushed to the LCD.</p> <p>When a sprite pixel has priority the color value is retrieved from the
popped pixel from the OAM FIFO. On DMG the color for the pixel is
retrieved from either the OBP1 or OBP0 register depending on the pixel's
palette property. If the palette property is 1 then OBP1 is used,
otherwise OBP0 is used. The pixel is then pushed to the LCD. On CGB when
palette access is blocked a black pixel is pushed to the LCD.</p> <p>The pixel is then finally pushed to the LCD.</p> <h4 id="cgb-palette-access"><a href="#cgb-palette-access" class="header-anchor">#</a> CGB Palette Access</h4> <p>At various times during PPU operation read access to the CGB palette is
blocked and a black pixel pushed to the LCD when rendering pixels:</p> <ul><li>LCD turning off</li> <li>First HBlank of the frame</li> <li>When searching OAM and index 37 is reached</li> <li>After switching from mode 2 (oam search) to mode 3 (pixel transfer)</li> <li>When entering HBlank (mode 0) and not in double speed mode, blocked 2 cycles later no matter what</li></ul> <p>At various times during PPU operation read access to the CGB palette is
restored and pixels are pushed to the LCD normally when rendering pixels:</p> <ul><li>At the end of mode 2 (oam search)</li> <li>For only 2 cycles when entering HBlank (mode 0) and in double speed mode</li></ul> <div class="custom-block warning"><p class="custom-block-title">Note</p> <p>These conditions are checked only when entering STOP mode and the

fetching an object from OAM. This abortion lengthens mode 3 by the amount
of cycles the previous instruction took plus the residual cycles left for
the PPU to process. When OAM fetching is aborted a pixel is <a href="#pixel-rendering">rendered</a>,
the <a href="#fifo-pixel-fetcher">fetcher</a> is advanced one step. This advancement
lengthens mode 3 by 1 cycle if the current pixel is not 160. If the

be supplied by another computer (for example if connected to a PC's
parallel port), in that case the external clock may have any speed. Even
the old/monochrome Game Boy is reported to recognizes external clocks of
up to 500 kHz. And there is no limitation into the other direction - even
when suppling an external clock speed of &quot;1 bit per month&quot;, then the
Game Boy will still eagerly wait for the next bit(s) to be transferred.
It isn't required that the clock pulses are sent at an regular interval
either.</p> <h4 id="timeouts"><a href="#timeouts" class="header-anchor">#</a> Timeouts</h4> <p>When using external clock then the transfer will not complete until the
last bit is received. In case that the second Game Boy isn't supplying a
clock signal, if it gets turned off, or if there is no second Game Boy

transfer procedure should use a timeout counter, and abort the
communication if no response has been received during the timeout
interval.</p> <h4 id="delays-and-synchronization"><a href="#delays-and-synchronization" class="header-anchor">#</a> Delays and Synchronization</h4> <p>The master Game Boy should always execute a small
delay after each transfer, in order to ensure that the other

Game Boy with external clock must have set its transfer start bit before
the Game Boy with internal clock starts the transfer. Alternately, the
two Game Boy systems could switch between internal and external clock for each
transferred byte to ensure synchronization.</p> <p>Transfer is initiated when the master Game Boy sets its Transfer
Start Flag, regardless of the value of this flag on the other device.
This bit is automatically set to 0 (on both) at the end of transfer.

There are no start or stop bits.</p> <p>During a transfer, a byte is shifted in at the same time that a byte is
shifted out. The rate of the shift is determined by whether the clock
source is internal or external. The most significant bit is shifted in

to play Game Boy games on a SNES (Super Nintendo Entertainment System)
gaming console. In detail, you plug the Game Boy cartridge into the SGB
cartridge, then plug the SGB cartridge into the SNES, and then connect
the SNES to your TV Set. In result, games can be played and viewed on
the TV Set, and are controlled by using the SNES joypad(s).</p> <h4 id="more-technical-description"><a href="#more-technical-description" class="header-anchor">#</a> More Technical Description</h4> <p>The SGB cartridge just contains a normal Game Boy CPU and normal Game Boy
video controller. Normally the video signal from this controller would
be sent to the LCD screen, however, in this special case the SNES read
out the video signal and displays it on the TV set by using a special
SNES BIOS ROM which is located in the SGB cartridge. Also, normal
Game Boy sound output is forwared to the SNES and output to the TV Set,
vice versa, joypad input is forwared from the SNES controller(s) to the
Game Boy joypad inputs.</p> <h4 id="normal-monochrome-games"><a href="#normal-monochrome-games" class="header-anchor">#</a> Normal Monochrome Games</h4> <p>Any Game Boy games which have been designed for monochrome handheld
Game Boy systems will work with the SGB hardware as well. The SGB will
apply a four color palette to these games by replacing the normal four
grayshades. The 160x144 pixel gamescreen is displayed in the middle of
the 256x224 pixel SNES screen (the unused area is filled by a screen
border bitmap). The user may access built-in menues, allowing to change
color palette data, to select between several pre-defined borders, etc.</p> <p>Games that have been designed to support SGB functions may also access
the following additional features:</p> <h4 id="colorized-game-screen"><a href="#colorized-game-screen" class="header-anchor">#</a> Colorized Game Screen</h4> <p>There's limited ability to colorize the gamescreen by assigning custom
color palettes to each 20x18 display characters, however, this works
mainly for static display data such like title screens or status bars,
the 20x18 color attribute map is non-scrollable, and it is not possible
to assign separate colors to moveable foreground sprites (OBJs), so that
animated screen regions will be typically restricted to using a single
palette of four colors only.</p> <h4 id="snes-foreground-sprites"><a href="#snes-foreground-sprites" class="header-anchor">#</a> SNES Foreground Sprites</h4> <p>Up to 24 foreground sprites (OBJs) of 8x8 or 16x16 pixels, 16 colors can
be displayed. When replacing (or just overlaying) the normal Game Boy
OBJs by SNES OBJs it'd be thus possible to display OBJs with other
colors than normal background area. This method doesn't appear to be
very popular, even though it appears to be quite easy to implement,
however, the bottommost character line of the gamescreen will be masked
out because this area is used to transfer OAM data to the SNES.</p> <h4 id="the-sgb-border"><a href="#the-sgb-border" class="header-anchor">#</a> The SGB Border</h4> <p>The possibly most popular and most impressive feature is to replace the
default SGB screen border by a custom bitmap which is stored in the game
cartridge.</p> <h4 id="multiple-joypads"><a href="#multiple-joypads" class="header-anchor">#</a> Multiple Joypads</h4> <p>Up to four joypads can be conected to the SNES, and SGB software may
read-out each of these joypads separately, allowing up to four players
to play the same game simultaneously. Unlike for multiplayer handheld
games, this requires only one game cartridge and only one SGB/SNES, and
no link cables are required, the downside is that all players must share
the same display screen.</p> <h4 id="sound-functions"><a href="#sound-functions" class="header-anchor">#</a> Sound Functions</h4> <p>Beside for normal Game Boy sound, a number of digital sound effects is
pre-defined in the SNES BIOS, these effects may be accessed quite
easily. Programmers whom are familiar with SNES sounds may also access
the SNES sound chip, or use the SNES MIDI engine directly in order to
produce other sound effects or music.</p> <h4 id="taking-control-of-the-snes-cpu"><a href="#taking-control-of-the-snes-cpu" class="header-anchor">#</a> Taking Control of the SNES CPU</h4> <p>Finally, it is possible to write program code or data into SNES memory,
and to execute such program code by using the SNES CPU.</p> <h4 id="sgb-system-clock"><a href="#sgb-system-clock" class="header-anchor">#</a> SGB System Clock</h4> <p>Because the SGB is synchronized to the SNES CPU, the Game Boy system
clock is directly chained to the SNES system clock. In result, the
Game Boy CPU, video controller, timers, and sound frequencies will be all
operated approx 2.4% faster than handheld systems. Basically, this
should be no problem, and the game will just run a little bit faster.
However sensitive musicians may notice that sound frequencies are a bit
too high, programs that support SGB functions may avoid this effect by
reducing frequencies of Game Boy sounds when having detected SGB
hardware. Also, &quot;PAL version&quot; SNES models which use a
50Hz display refresh rate (rather than 60Hz) result in
respectively slower Game Boy timings.</p> <ul><li>NTSC SGB: 21.477 MHz master clock, 4.2955 MHz GB clock, 2.41% fast</li> <li>PAL SGB: 21.281 MHz master clock, 4.2563 MHz GB clock, 1.48% fast</li> <li>NTSC SGB2: Separate 20.972 MHz crystal, correct speed</li></ul> <h2 id="sgb-unlocking-and-detecting-sgb-functions"><a href="#sgb-unlocking-and-detecting-sgb-functions" class="header-anchor">#</a> SGB Unlocking and Detecting SGB Functions</h2> <h4 id="cartridge-header"><a href="#cartridge-header" class="header-anchor">#</a> Cartridge Header</h4> <p>SGB games are required to have a cartridge header with Nintendo and
proper checksum just as normal Game Boy games. Also, two special entries
must be set in order to unlock SGB functions:</p> <ul><li>146h - SGB Flag - Must be set to 03h for SGB games</li> <li>14Bh - Old Licensee Code - Must be set 33h for SGB games</li></ul> <p>When these entries aren't set, the game will still work just like all
&quot;monochrome&quot; Game Boy games, but it cannot access any of the special
SGB functions.</p> <h4 id="detecting-sgb-hardware"><a href="#detecting-sgb-hardware" class="header-anchor">#</a> Detecting SGB hardware</h4> <p>The recommended detection method is to send a MLT_REQ command which
enables two (or four) joypads. A normal handheld Game Boy will ignore
this command, a SGB will now return incrementing joypad IDs each time
when deselecting keyboard lines (see MLT_REQ description for details).
Now read-out joypad state/IDs several times, and if the ID-numbers are
changing, then it is a SGB (a normal Game Boy would typically always
return 0Fh as ID). Finally, when not intending to use more than one
joypad, send another MLT_REQ command in order to re-disable the
multi-controller mode. Detection works regardless of whether and how
many joypads are physically connected to the SNES. However, detection
works only when having unlocked SGB functions in the cartridge header,
as described above.</p> <h4 id="separating-between-sgb-and-sgb2"><a href="#separating-between-sgb-and-sgb2" class="header-anchor">#</a> Separating between SGB and SGB2</h4> <p>It is also possible to separate between SGB and SGB2 models by examining

still required to use the above MLT_REQ detection procedure. As far as
I know the SGB2 doesn't have any extra features which'd require
separate SGB2 detection except for curiosity purposes, for example, the
game &quot;Tetris DX&quot; chooses to display an alternate SGB border on SGB2s.</p> <p>Only the SGB2 contains a link port.</p> <h2 id="sgb-command-packet-transfers"><a href="#sgb-command-packet-transfers" class="header-anchor">#</a> SGB Command Packet Transfers</h2> <p>Command packets (aka Register Files) are transferred from the Game Boy to
the SNES by using P14 and P15 output lines of the JOYPAD register
(FF00h).  These same lines are also used to select the two rows in the
Game Boy keyboard matrix (which still works).</p> <h4 id="transferring-bits"><a href="#transferring-bits" class="header-anchor">#</a> Transferring Bits</h4> <p>A command packet transfer must be initiated by setting both P14 and P15
to LOW, this will reset and start the SNES packet receiving program.
Data is then transferred (LSB first), setting P14=LOW will indicate a
&quot;0&quot; bit, and setting P15=LOW will indicate a &quot;1&quot; bit. For example:</p> <div class="language- extra-class"><pre class="language-text"><code>    RESET  0   0   1   1   0   1   0
P14  --_---_---_-----------_-------_--...

</code></pre></div><p>Data and reset pulses must be kept LOW for at least 5us. P14 and P15
must be kept both HIGH for at least 15us between any pulses. Obviously,
it'd be no good idea to access the JOYPAD register during the transfer,
for example, in case that your VBlank interrupt procedure reads-out
joypad states each frame, be sure to disable that interrupt during the
transfer (or disable only the joypad procedure by using a software
flag).</p> <h4 id="transferring-packets"><a href="#transferring-packets" class="header-anchor">#</a> Transferring Packets</h4> <p>Each packet is invoked by a RESET pulse, then 128 bits of data are
transferred (16 bytes, LSB of first byte first), and finally, a
&quot;0&quot; bit must be transferred as stop bit. The structure of normal
packets thus is:</p> <ol><li>1 pulse: Start signal</li> <li>1 byte: Header byte (Command Code * 8 + Length)</li> <li>15 bytes: Parameter Data</li> <li>1 bit: Stop Bit (0)</li></ol> <p>The above &quot;Length&quot; indicates the total number of packets (1-7,
including the first packet) which will be sent.  If more than 15
parameter bytes are used, then further packet(s) will follow, as such:</p> <ol><li>1 pulse: Start signal</li> <li>16 bytes: Parameter Data</li> <li>1 bit: Stop Bit (0)</li></ol> <p>By using all 7 packets, up to 111 data bytes (15+16*6) may be sent.
Unused bytes at the end of the last packet don't matter. A 60ms (4
frames) delay should be invoked between each packet transfer.</p> <h2 id="sgb-vram-transfers"><a href="#sgb-vram-transfers" class="header-anchor">#</a> SGB VRAM Transfers</h2> <h4 id="overview-2"><a href="#overview-2" class="header-anchor">#</a> Overview</h4> <p>Beside for the packet transfer method, larger data blocks of 4KBytes can
be transferred by using the video signal. These transfers are invoked by
first sending one of the commands with the ending _TRN (by using normal
packet transfer), the 4K data block is then read-out by the SNES from
Game Boy display memory during the next frame.</p> <h4 id="transfer-data"><a href="#transfer-data" class="header-anchor">#</a> Transfer Data</h4> <p>Normally, transfer data should be stored at 8000h-8FFFh in Game Boy VRAM,
even though the SNES receives the data in from display scanlines, it
will automatically re-produce the same ordering of bits and bytes, as
being originally stored at 8000h-8FFFh in Game Boy memory.</p> <h4 id="preparing-the-display"><a href="#preparing-the-display" class="header-anchor">#</a> Preparing the Display</h4> <p>The above method works only when recursing the following things: BG Map
must display unsigned characters 00h-FFh on the screen; 00h..13h in
first line, 14h..27h in next line, etc. The Game Boy display must be
enabled, the display may not be scrolled, OBJ sprites should not overlap
the background tiles, the BGP palette register must be set to E4h.</p> <h4 id="transfer-time"><a href="#transfer-time" class="header-anchor">#</a> Transfer Time</h4> <p>Note that the transfer data should be prepared in VRAM <strong>before</strong> sending
the transfer command packet. The actual transfer starts at the beginning
of the next frame after the command has been sent, and the transfer ends
at the end of the 5th frame after the command has been sent (not
counting the frame in which the command has been sent). The displayed
data must not be modified during the transfer, as the SGB reads it in
multiple chunks.</p> <h4 id="avoiding-screen-garbage"><a href="#avoiding-screen-garbage" class="header-anchor">#</a> Avoiding Screen Garbage</h4> <p>The display will contain &quot;garbage&quot; during the transfer, this
dirt-effect can be avoided by freezing the screen (in the state which
has been displayed before the transfer) by using the MASK_EN command.
Of course, this works only when actually executing the game on a SGB
(and not on handheld Game Boy systems), it'd be thus required to detect
the presence of SGB hardware before blindly sending VRAM data.</p> <h2 id="sgb-command-summary"><a href="#sgb-command-summary" class="header-anchor">#</a> SGB Command Summary</h2> <h4 id="sgb-system-command-table"><a href="#sgb-system-command-table" class="header-anchor">#</a> SGB System Command Table</h4> <table><thead><tr><th>Code</th> <th>Name</th> <th>Explanation</th></tr></thead> <tbody><tr><td>$00</td> <td>PAL01</td> <td>Set SGB Palette 0 &amp; 1</td></tr> <tr><td>$01</td> <td>PAL23</td> <td>Set SGB Palette 2 &amp; 3</td></tr> <tr><td>$02</td> <td>PAL03</td> <td>Set SGB Palette 0 &amp; 3</td></tr> <tr><td>$03</td> <td>PAL12</td> <td>Set SGB Palette 1 &amp; 2</td></tr> <tr><td>$04</td> <td>ATTR_BLK</td> <td>&quot;Block&quot; Area Designation Mode</td></tr> <tr><td>$05</td> <td>ATTR_LIN</td> <td>&quot;Line&quot; Area Designation Mode</td></tr> <tr><td>$06</td> <td>ATTR_DIV</td> <td>&quot;Divide&quot; Area Designation Mode</td></tr> <tr><td>$07</td> <td>ATTR_CHR</td> <td>&quot;1CHR&quot; Area Designation Mode</td></tr> <tr><td>$08</td> <td>SOUND</td> <td>Sound On/Off</td></tr> <tr><td>$09</td> <td>SOU_TRN</td> <td>Transfer Sound PRG/DATA</td></tr> <tr><td>$0A</td> <td>PAL_SET</td> <td>Set SGB Palette Indirect</td></tr> <tr><td>$0B</td> <td>PAL_TRN</td> <td>Set System Color Palette Data</td></tr> <tr><td>$0C</td> <td>ATRC_EN</td> <td>Enable/disable Attraction Mode</td></tr> <tr><td>$0D</td> <td>TEST_EN</td> <td>Speed Function</td></tr> <tr><td>$0E</td> <td>ICON_EN</td> <td>SGB Function</td></tr> <tr><td>$0F</td> <td>DATA_SND</td> <td>SUPER NES WRAM Transfer 1</td></tr> <tr><td>$10</td> <td>DATA_TRN</td> <td>SUPER NES WRAM Transfer 2</td></tr> <tr><td>$11</td> <td>MLT_REG</td> <td>Controller 2 Request</td></tr> <tr><td>$12</td> <td>JUMP</td> <td>Set SNES Program Counter</td></tr> <tr><td>$13</td> <td>CHR_TRN</td> <td>Transfer Character Font Data</td></tr> <tr><td>$14</td> <td>PCT_TRN</td> <td>Set Screen Data Color Data</td></tr> <tr><td>$15</td> <td>ATTR_TRN</td> <td>Set Attribute from ATF</td></tr> <tr><td>$16</td> <td>ATTR_SET</td> <td>Set Data to ATF</td></tr> <tr><td>$17</td> <td>MASK_EN</td> <td>Game Boy Window Mask</td></tr> <tr><td>$18</td> <td>OBJ_TRN</td> <td>Super NES OBJ Mode</td></tr></tbody></table> <h2 id="sgb-color-palettes-overview"><a href="#sgb-color-palettes-overview" class="header-anchor">#</a> SGB Color Palettes Overview</h2> <h4 id="available-snes-palettes"><a href="#available-snes-palettes" class="header-anchor">#</a> Available SNES Palettes</h4> <p>The SGB/SNES provides 8 palettes of 16 colors each, each color may be
defined out of a selection of 32768 colors (15 bit). Palettes 0-3 are
used to colorize the gamescreen, only the first four colors of each of
these palettes are used. Palettes 4-7 are used for the SGB Border, all
16 colors of each of these palettes may be used.</p> <h4 id="color-format"><a href="#color-format" class="header-anchor">#</a> Color format</h4> <p>Colors are encoded as 16-bit RGB numbers, in the following way:</p> <div class="language- extra-class"><pre class="language-text"><code>FEDC BA98 7654 3210
0BBB BBGG GGGR RRRR
</code></pre></div><p>Here's a formula to convert 24-bit RGB into SNES format:
<code>(color &amp; 0xF8) &lt;&lt; 7 | (color &amp; 0xF800) &gt;&gt; 6 | (color &amp; 0xF80000) &gt;&gt; 19</code><br></p> <p>The palettes are encoded <strong>little-endian</strong>, thus, the R/G byte comes
first in memory.</p> <h4 id="color-0-restriction"><a href="#color-0-restriction" class="header-anchor">#</a> Color 0 Restriction</h4> <p>Color 0 of each of the eight palettes is transparent, causing the
backdrop color to be displayed instead. The backdrop color is typically
defined by the most recently color being assigned to Color 0 (regardless
of the palette number being used for that operation). Effectively,
gamescreen palettes can have only three custom colors each, and SGB
border palettes only 15 colors each, additionally, color 0 can be used
for for all palettes, which will then all share the same color though.</p> <h4 id="translation-of-grayshades-into-colors"><a href="#translation-of-grayshades-into-colors" class="header-anchor">#</a> Translation of Grayshades into Colors</h4> <p>Because the SGB/SNES reads out the Game Boy video controllers display
signal, it translates the different grayshades from the signal into SNES
colors as such:</p> <div class="language- extra-class"><pre class="language-text"><code>White       --&gt;  Color #0
Light Gray  --&gt;  Color #1
Dark Gray   --&gt;  Color #2
Black       --&gt;  Color #3
</code></pre></div><p>Note that Game Boy colors 0-3 are assigned to user-selectable grayshades
by the Game Boy's BGP, OBP0, and OBP1 registers. There is thus no fixed
relationship between Game Boy colors 0-3 and SNES colors 0-3.</p> <h5 id="using-game-boy-bgp-obp-registers"><a href="#using-game-boy-bgp-obp-registers" class="header-anchor">#</a> Using Game Boy BGP/OBP Registers</h5> <p>A direct translation of GB color 0-3 into SNES color 0-3 may be produced
by setting BGP/OBPx registers to a value of 0E4h each. However, in case
that your program uses black background for example, then you may
internally assign background as &quot;White&quot; at the Game Boy side by BGP/OBP
registers (which is then interpreted as SNES color 0, which is shared
for all SNES palettes). The advantage is that you may define Color 0 as
Black at the SNES side, and may assign custom colors for Colors 1-3 of
each SNES palette.</p> <h4 id="system-color-palette-memory"><a href="#system-color-palette-memory" class="header-anchor">#</a> System Color Palette Memory</h4> <p>Beside for the actually visible palettes, up to 512 palettes of 4 colors
each may be defined in SNES RAM. The palettes are just stored in RAM
without any relationship to the displayed picture; however, these

slightly faster than when transferring palette data by separate command

Because this function provides feedback from the SGB/SNES to the Game
Boy program, it is also used to detect SGB hardware.</p> <p><code>Byte Content</code><br> <code>0 Command*8+Length (fixed length=1)</code><br> <code>1 Multiplayer Control (0-3) (Bit0=Enable, Bit1=Two/Four Players)</code><br> <code>0 = One player</code><br> <code>1 = Two players</code><br> <code>3 = Four players</code><br> <code>2-F Not used (zero)</code><br></p> <p>In one player mode, the second joypad (if any) is used for the SGB

Because SNES have only two joypad sockets, four player mode requires an
external &quot;Multiplayer 5&quot; adapter.</p> <p>Changing the number of active players ANDs the currently selected player
minus one with the number of players in that mode minus one. For example
if you go from four players to two players and player 4 was active
player 2 will then be active because 3 AND 1 is 1. However, sending the
MLT_REQ command will increment the counter several times so results may
not be exactly as expected. The most frequent case is going from one
player to two-or-four player which will always start with player 1
active.</p> <h4 id="reading-multiple-controllers-joypads"><a href="#reading-multiple-controllers-joypads" class="header-anchor">#</a> Reading Multiple Controllers (Joypads)</h4> <p>When having enabled multiple controllers by MLT_REQ, data for each
joypad can be read out through JOYPAD register (FF00) as follows: First
set P14 and P15 both HIGH (deselect both Buttons and Cursor keys), you
can now read the lower 4 bits of $FF00 which indicate the joypad ID for
the following joypad input:</p> <table><thead><tr><th>Byte</th> <th>Player #</th></tr></thead> <tbody><tr><td>$0F</td> <td>1</td></tr> <tr><td>$0E</td> <td>2</td></tr> <tr><td>$0D</td> <td>3</td></tr> <tr><td>$0C</td> <td>4</td></tr></tbody></table> <p>Next, read joypad state as normally. When completed, set P14 and P15
back HIGH, this automatically increments the joypad number (or restarts
counting once reached the lastmost joypad). Repeat the procedure until
you have read-out states for all two (or four) joypads.</p> <p>If for whatever reason you want to increment the joypad number without
reading the joypad state you only need to set P15 to LOW before setting
it back to HIGH. Adjusting P14 does not affect whether or not the joypad
number will advance, However, if you set P15 to LOW then HIGH then LOW
again without bringing both P14 and P15 HIGH at any point, it cancels
the increment until P15 is lowered again. There are games, such as
Pokémon Yellow, which rely on this cancelling when detecting the SGB.</p> <h2 id="sgb-border-and-obj-commands"><a href="#sgb-border-and-obj-commands" class="header-anchor">#</a> SGB Border and OBJ Commands</h2> <h4 id="sgb-command-13h-chr-trn"><a href="#sgb-command-13h-chr-trn" class="header-anchor">#</a> SGB Command 13h - CHR_TRN</h4> <p>Used to transfer tile data (characters) to SNES Tile memory in VRAM.

window to be displayed inside. Non-transparent border data will cover
the Game Boy window (for example, <em>Mario's Picross</em> does this, as does
<em>WildSnake</em> to a lesser extent).</p> <p>All borders repeat tiles. Assuming that the blank space for the GB
screen is a single tile, as is the letterbox in a widescreen border, a

whether the previous instruction has been a subtraction,
and H indicates carry for the lower 4 bits of the result. DAA also uses the C flag,
which must indicate carry for the upper 4 bits. After adding/subtracting two
BCD numbers, DAA is used to convert the result to BCD format. BCD
numbers range from $00 to $99 rather than $00 to $FF. Because only two flags
(C and H) exist to indicate carry-outs of BCD digits, DAA is ineffective for
16-bit operations (which have 4 digits), and use for INC/DEC operations
(which do not affect C-flag) has limits.</p> <h1 id="instruction-set"><a href="#instruction-set" class="header-anchor">#</a> Instruction Set</h1> <p>Tables below specify the mnemonic, encoding, clock cycles, affected

checksum bytes). The Game Boy doesn't verify this checksum.</p> <h1 id="memory-bank-controllers"><a href="#memory-bank-controllers" class="header-anchor">#</a> Memory Bank Controllers</h1> <p>As the Game Boy's 16-bit address bus offers only limited space for
ROM and RAM addressing, many games are using Memory Bank Controllers
(MBCs) to expand the available address space by bank switching.
These MBC chips are located in the game cartridge (that is, not in
the Game Boy itself).</p> <p>In each cartridge, the required (or preferred) MBC type should be
specified in the byte at 0147h of the ROM, as described in
<a href="#the-cartridge-header">the cartridge header</a>.  Several different MBC
types are available:</p> <h1 id="no-mbc"><a href="#no-mbc" class="header-anchor">#</a> No MBC</h1> <p>(32KByte ROM only)</p> <p>Small games of not more than 32 KiB ROM do not require a MBC chip for
ROM banking. The ROM is directly mapped to memory at 0000-7FFFh.
Optionally up to 8 KiB of RAM could be connected at A000-BFFF, using
a discrete logic decoder  in place of a full MBC chip.</p> <h1 id="mbc1"><a href="#mbc1" class="header-anchor">#</a> MBC1</h1> <p>(max 2MByte ROM and/or 32KByte RAM)</p> <p>This is the first MBC chip for the Game Boy. Any newer MBC chips
work similarly, so it is relatively easy to upgrade a program from one
MBC chip to another - or to make it compatible with several different
types of MBCs.</p> <p>Note that the memory in range 0000-7FFF is used both for reading from
ROM and writing to the MBCs Control Registers.</p> <h3 id="rom-ram-access"><a href="#rom-ram-access" class="header-anchor">#</a> ROM/RAM access</h3> <h4 id="_0000-3fff-rom-bank-00-20-40-60-read-only"><a href="#_0000-3fff-rom-bank-00-20-40-60-read-only" class="header-anchor">#</a> 0000-3FFF - ROM Bank 00/20/40/60 (Read Only)</h4> <p>This area normally contains the first 16KBytes (bank 00) of the cartridge
ROM. Can contain banks 20/40/60 in mode 1 (see below), or banks 10/20/30
in mode 1 for a 1MB MBC1 multi-cart (see below).</p> <h4 id="_4000-7fff-rom-bank-01-7f-read-only"><a href="#_4000-7fff-rom-bank-01-7f-read-only" class="header-anchor">#</a> 4000-7FFF - ROM Bank 01-7F (Read Only)</h4> <p>This area may contain any of the further 16KByte banks of the ROM. Cannot
address any banks where the main ROM banking register would be 00h, which
usually means banks 00/20/40/60. Instead, it automatically maps to 1 bank
higher (01/21/41/61).</p> <h4 id="a000-bfff-ram-bank-00-03-if-any-read-write"><a href="#a000-bfff-ram-bank-00-03-if-any-read-write" class="header-anchor">#</a> A000-BFFF - RAM Bank 00-03, if any (Read/Write)</h4> <p>This area is used to address external RAM in the cartridge (if any).
External RAM is often battery-backed, allowing for the storage of game data while the Game Boy is turned off, or if the
cartridge is removed from the Game Boy. Available RAM sizes are: 2KByte
(at A000-A7FF), 8KByte (at A000-BFFF) and 32KByte (in form of four 8K
banks at A000-BFFF).</p> <h3 id="control-registers"><a href="#control-registers" class="header-anchor">#</a> Control Registers</h3> <h4 id="_0000-1fff-ram-enable-write-only"><a href="#_0000-1fff-ram-enable-write-only" class="header-anchor">#</a> 0000-1FFF - RAM Enable (Write Only)</h4> <p>Before external RAM can be read or written, it must be enabled by
writing to this address space. It is recommended to disable external RAM
after accessing it, in order to protect its contents from corruption during
power down of the Game Boy. Usually the following values are used:</p> <div class="language- extra-class"><pre class="language-text"><code>00h  Disable RAM (default)
0Ah  Enable RAM
</code></pre></div><p>Practically any value with 0Ah in the lower 4 bits enables RAM and any
other value disables RAM. RAM is automatically disabled when the gameboy
is powered off. It is unknown why Ah is the value used to enable RAM.</p> <h4 id="_2000-3fff-rom-bank-number-write-only"><a href="#_2000-3fff-rom-bank-number-write-only" class="header-anchor">#</a> 2000-3FFF - ROM Bank Number (Write Only)</h4> <p>This 5 bit register (range 01h-1Fh) selects the ROM bank number. Higher
bits are discarded - E1h (binary <s>111</s>00001) would select bank 01h.
If the ROM Bank Number is set to a higher value than the number of banks
in the cart, the bank number is masked to the required number of bits.
e.g. a 256 kB cart only needs a 4 bit bank number to address all of its
16 banks, so this register is masked to 4 bits. The upper bit would be
ignored.</p> <p>On larger carts which need a &gt;5 bit bank number, the secondary banking
register at 4000-5FFF is used to supply an additional 2 bits for the
effective bank number:
<code>Selected ROM Bank = (Secondary Bank &lt;&lt; 5) + ROM Bank</code>.</p> <p>The ROM Bank Number defaults to 01h at power-on. When 00h is written,
the MBC translates that to bank 01h also. Not being able to select bank
00h isn't normally a problem, because bank 00h is usually mapped to the
0000-3FFF range. But on large carts (using the secondary banking register
to specify the upper ROM Bank bits), the same happens for banks 20h, 40h,
and 60h, as this register would need to be 00h for those addresses. Any
attempt to address these ROM Banks will select Bank 21h, 41h and 61h
instead. The only way to access banks 20h, 40h or 60h is to enter mode 1,
which remaps the 0000-3FFF range. This has its own problems for game
developers as that range contains interrupt handlers, so it's usually only
used in multi-game compilation carts (see below).</p> <h4 id="_4000-5fff-ram-bank-number-or-upper-bits-of-rom-bank-number-write-only"><a href="#_4000-5fff-ram-bank-number-or-upper-bits-of-rom-bank-number-write-only" class="header-anchor">#</a> 4000-5FFF - RAM Bank Number - or - Upper Bits of ROM Bank Number (Write Only)</h4> <p>This second 2 bit register can be used to select a RAM Bank in range from
00-03h (32 kB ram carts only), or to specify the upper two bits (Bit 5-6)
of the ROM Bank number (1 MB ROM or larger carts only). If neither ROM nor
RAM is large enough, setting this register does nothing.</p> <p>In 1MB MBC1 multi-carts (see below), this 2 bit register is instead
applied to bits 4-5 of the ROM bank number and the top bit of the main
5-bit main ROM banking register is ignored.</p> <h4 id="_6000-7fff-banking-mode-select-write-only"><a href="#_6000-7fff-banking-mode-select-write-only" class="header-anchor">#</a> 6000-7FFF - Banking Mode Select (Write Only)</h4> <p>This 1bit Register selects between the two MBC1 banking modes, controlling
the behaviour of the secondary 2 bit banking register (above). If the cart
is not large enough to use the 2 bit register (&lt;= 8kB RAM / &lt;= 512 kB ROM)
this mode select has no observable effect. The program may freely switch
between the two modes at any time.</p> <div class="language- extra-class"><pre class="language-text"><code>00h = Simple ROM Banking Mode (default)
01h = RAM Banking Mode / Advanced ROM Banking Mode
</code></pre></div><p>In mode 0, the 2-bit secondary banking register can only affect the
4000-7FFF banked ROM area. If the cart is a &quot;small ROM&quot;/&quot;large RAM&quot; cart
(&lt;1 MB ROM, &gt;8kB RAM) then 4000-7FFF is unaffected by this register anyway,
so the practical effect is that RAM banking is disabled and A000-BFFF is
locked to only be able to access bank 0 of RAM, with the 2-bit secondary
banking register entirely ignored.</p> <p>In mode 1, the behaviour differs depending on whether the current cart is
a &quot;large RAM&quot; cart (&gt;8kB RAM) or &quot;large ROM&quot; cart (1 MB or larger). For
large RAM carts, switching to mode 1 enables RAM banking and (if RAM is
enabled) immediately switches the A000-BFFF RAM area to the bank selected
by the 2-bit secondary banking register.</p> <p>For &quot;large ROM&quot; carts, mode 1 has the 4000-7FFF banked ROM area behave the
same as mode 0, but additionally the &quot;unbankable&quot; &quot;bank 0&quot; area 0000-3FFF
is now also affected by the 2-bit secondary banking register, meaning it
can now be switched between banks 00h, 20h, 40h and 60h. These banks are
inaccessible in mode 0 - they cannot be mapped to the 4000-7FFF banked ROM
area.</p> <h4 id="note-for-1-mb-multi-game-compilation-carts"><a href="#note-for-1-mb-multi-game-compilation-carts" class="header-anchor">#</a> Note for 1 MB Multi-Game Compilation Carts</h4> <p>Also known as MBC1m, these carts have an alternative wiring, that ignores
the top bit of the main ROM banking register (making it a 4 bit register)
and applies the 2 bit register to bits 4-5 of the bank number (instead of
the usual bits 5-6). This means that in mode 1 the 2 bit register selects
banks 00h, 10h, 20h, or 30h, rather than the usual 00h, 20h, 40h or 60h.</p> <p>These carts make use of the fact that mode 1 remaps the 0000-3FFF area
to switch games. The 2 bit register is used to select the game - switching
the zero bank and the region of banks that the 4000-7FFF rom area can
access to those for the selected game and then the game only changes the
main ROM banking register. As far as the selected game knows, it's running
from a 256 kB cart!</p> <p>These carts can normally be identified by having a Nintendo copyright
header in bank 0x10. A badly dumped multi-cart ROM can be identified by
having duplicate content in banks 10-1Fh (dupe of 00-0Fh) and banks 30-3Fh
(dupe of 20-2Fh).
There is a known bad dump of the Mortal Kombat I &amp; II collection around.</p> <p>An &quot;MBC1M&quot; compilation cart ROM can be converted into a regular MBC1 ROM
by increasing the ROM size to 2MB and duplicating each sub-rom - 00-0Fh
duplicated into 10-1Fh, the original 10-1Fh placed in 20-2Fh and
duplicated into 30-3Fh and so on.</p> <h1 id="mbc2"><a href="#mbc2" class="header-anchor">#</a> MBC2</h1> <p>(max 256KByte ROM and 512x4 bits RAM)</p> <h3 id="rom-ram-access-2"><a href="#rom-ram-access-2" class="header-anchor">#</a> ROM/RAM Access</h3> <h4 id="_0000-3fff-rom-bank-00-read-only"><a href="#_0000-3fff-rom-bank-00-read-only" class="header-anchor">#</a> 0000-3FFF - ROM Bank 00 (Read Only)</h4> <p>Contains the first 16KByte banks of the ROM.</p> <h4 id="_4000-7fff-rom-bank-01-0f-read-only"><a href="#_4000-7fff-rom-bank-01-0f-read-only" class="header-anchor">#</a> 4000-7FFF - ROM Bank 01-0F (Read Only)</h4> <p>Same as for MBC1, but only a total of 16 ROM banks is supported.</p> <h4 id="a000-a1ff-512x4bits-ram-built-in-into-the-mbc2-chip-read-write"><a href="#a000-a1ff-512x4bits-ram-built-in-into-the-mbc2-chip-read-write" class="header-anchor">#</a> A000-A1FF - 512x4bits RAM, built-in into the MBC2 chip (Read/Write)</h4> <p>The MBC2 doesn't support external RAM, instead it includes 512x4 bits

make the flash read out status bytes instead of values. A status of $80
means the operation has finished and you should exit the mode using the
appropriate command. A status of $10 indicates a timeout.</p> <p>Programming must be done by first erasing a sector, activating write
mode, writing out 128 bytes (aligned), then writing a 0 to the final
address to commit the write, waiting for the status to indicate
completion, and writing $F0 to the final address again to exit program
mode. If a sector is not erased first programming will not work
properly. In some cases it will only allow the stored bytes to be anded
instead of replaced; in others it just won't work at all. The only way
to set the bits back to 1 is to erase the sector entirely. It is
recommended to check the flash to make sure all bytes were written
properly and re-write (without erasing) the 128 byte block if some bits
didn't get set to 0 properly. After writing all blocks in a sector
Flash Write Enable should be set to 0.</p> <p>Source: <a href="http://gbdev.gg8.se/forums/viewtopic.php?id=544" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg></a></p> <h1 id="mbc7"><a href="#mbc7" class="header-anchor">#</a> MBC7</h1> <h3 id="overview-4"><a href="#overview-4" class="header-anchor">#</a> Overview</h3> <p>MBC7 (Memory Bank Controller 7) is an MBC containing a 2-axis

consisting of a 74LS377 octal latch, aside from the ROM chip. Because
the mapper consists of a single standard 74 series logic chip, it has
two unusual properties:</p> <p>First, unlike a usual MBC, it switches the whole 32 kiB ROM area instead
of just the $4000-$7FFF area. If you want to use the interrupt vectors
with this cart, you should duplicate them across all banks.
Additionally, since the initial state of the '377 can't be guaranteed,
the ROM header and some code for switching to a known bank should also
be included in every bank. This also means that the Wisdom Tree mapper
could be used as a multicart mapper for 32 kiB ROMs, assuming there was
enough ROM space in each bank for some small initialization code, and
none of the ROMs wrote to the $0000-$7FFF area. For example, if the
last 5 bytes of all banks are unused, games can be patched as follows:</p> <div class="language- extra-class"><pre><code>; At $0100 in all banks but the first
  nop
  jp $7FFB

; At $7FFB in all banks
  ld hl, $0100
  ld [hl], a
  jp hl
</code></pre></div><p>Second, because the '377 latches data on the <em>positive</em> edge, and the
value on the Game Boy data bus is no longer valid when the positive edge
of the write pulse arrives, the designer of this mapper chose to use the
A7-A0 address lines for selecting a bank instead of the data lines.
Thus, the value you write is ignored, and the lower 8 bits of the
address is used. For example, to select bank $XX, you would write any
value to address $YYXX, where $YY is in the range $00-$7F.</p> <p>An emulator can detect a ROM designed for Wisdom Tree mapper in one of
two ways:</p> <ul><li>ROM contains &quot;WISDOM TREE&quot; or &quot;WISDOM\x00TREE&quot; (the space can
be $20 or $00), $0147 = $00, $0148 = $00, size &gt; 32k. This
method works for the games released by Wisdom Tree, Inc.</li> <li>$0147 = $C0, $014A = $D1. These are the values recommended by
beware for 3rd party developers to indicate that the ROM is
targeting Wisdom Tree mapper hardware. (See below.)</li></ul> <h4 id="magic-values-for-detection-of-multicarts-in-emulators"><a href="#magic-values-for-detection-of-multicarts-in-emulators" class="header-anchor">#</a> Magic values for detection of multicarts in emulators</h4> <p>Sometimes it may be useful to allow a ROM to be detected as a multicart
in emulator, for example for development of a menu for physical
multicart hardware. These are values suggested by beware, and supported
in BGB, for signaling that your ROM is supposed to interface a multicart
mapper. Emulator authors who are interested in supporting multicart
mappers are encouraged to support detection of these values in addition
to the values described in each section, which are heuristics based on
ROMs in the wild, which may not always be suitable for newly produced
software. The values are deliberately chosen to be high entropy
(&quot;random&quot;) such that the risk of an accidental false positive is
unlikely.</p> <ul><li>$0147 = $c0, $014a = $d1 -&gt; Detect as Wisdom Tree</li> <li>$0147 = $1b, $014a = $e1 -&gt; Detect as EMS multicart</li> <li>$0147 = $be -&gt; Detect as Bung multicart</li></ul> <h3 id="mbc-timing-issues"><a href="#mbc-timing-issues" class="header-anchor">#</a> MBC Timing Issues</h3> <p>Among Nintendo MBCs, only the MBC5 is guaranteed by Nintendo to support

so, it might be nevertheless possible to use Double Speed during periods

Always set these registers on reset rather than assume they are as above.</p> <p>Please note that Game Boy internal RAM on power up contains random data.</p> <p>All of the Game Boy emulators tend to set all RAM to value $00 on entry.</p> <p>Cart RAM the first time it is accessed on a real Game Boy contains random data.
It will only contain known data if the Game Boy code initializes it to some value.</p> <h1 id="reducing-power-consumption"><a href="#reducing-power-consumption" class="header-anchor">#</a> Reducing Power Consumption</h1> <p>The following programming techniques can be used to reduce the power
consumption of the Game Boy hardware and extend the life of the
batteries.</p> <h2 id="using-the-halt-instruction"><a href="#using-the-halt-instruction" class="header-anchor">#</a> Using the HALT Instruction</h2> <p>The HALT instruction should be used whenever possible to reduce power
consumption &amp; extend the life of the batteries. This command stops the
system clock, reducing the power consumption of both the CPU and ROM.</p> <p>The CPU will remain stopped until an interrupt occurs at which point the
interrupt is serviced and then the instruction immediately following the
HALT is executed.</p> <p>Depending on how much CPU time is required by a game, the HALT
instruction can extend battery life anywhere from 5 to 50% or possibly
more.</p> <p>When waiting for a vblank event, this would be a BAD example:</p> <div class="language- extra-class"><pre class="language-text"><code> @@wait:
  ld   a,(0FF44h)      ;LY
  cp   a,144
  jr   nz,@@wait
</code></pre></div><p>A better example would be a procedure as shown below. In this case the
vblank interrupt must be enabled, and your vblank interrupt procedure
must set vblank_flag to a non-zero value.</p> <div class="language- extra-class"><pre class="language-text"><code>  ld   hl,vblank_flag  ;hl=pointer to vblank_flag
  xor  a               ;a=0
 @@wait:               ;wait...
  halt                 ;suspend CPU - wait for ANY interrupt
  cp   a,(hl)          ;vblank flag still zero?
  jr   z,@@wait        ;wait more if zero
  ld   (hl),a          ;set vblank_flag back to zero
</code></pre></div><p>The vblank_flag is used to determine whether the HALT period has been
terminated by a vblank interrupt, or by another interrupt. In case your
program has all other interrupts disabled, then it would be okay to
replace the above procedure by a single HALT instruction.</p> <p>Another possibility is, if your game uses no other interrupt than VBlank
(or uses no interrupt), to only enable VBlank interrupts and simply use
a halt instruction, which will only resume main code execution when a
VBlank occurs.</p> <p>Remember when using HALT to wait between VBlanks, your interrupt
routines MUST enable interrupts (ie with ei during the execution, or
better, using the RETI instruction)</p> <h2 id="using-the-stop-instruction"><a href="#using-the-stop-instruction" class="header-anchor">#</a> Using the STOP Instruction</h2> <p>The STOP instruction is intended to switch the Game Boy into VERY low
power standby mode. For example, a program may use this feature when it
hasn't sensed keyboard input for a longer period (for example, when
somebody forgot to turn off the Game Boy).</p> <p>No licensed rom makes use of STOP outside of CGB speed switching.
Special care needs to be taken if you want to make use of the STOP
instruction.</p> <p>On a DMG, disabling the LCD before invoking STOP leaves the LCD enabled,
drawing a horizontal black line on the screen and very likely damaging the
hardware.</p> <p>On CGB, leaving the LCD enabled when invoking STOP will result in a
black screen. Except if the LCD is in Mode 3, where it will keep drawing
the current screen.</p> <p>STOP is terminated by one of the P10 to P13 lines going low. For this
reason, d-pad and/or button inputs should be enabled by writing $00,
$10 or $20 to the <code>P1</code> register before entering STOP (depending on which
buttons you want to terminate the STOP on).</p> <h2 id="disabling-the-sound-controller"><a href="#disabling-the-sound-controller" class="header-anchor">#</a> Disabling the Sound Controller</h2> <p>If your program doesn't use sound at all (or during some periods) then
write 00h to register FF26 to save 16% or more on GB power consumption.
Sound can be turned back on by writing 80h to the same register, all
sound registers must be then re-initialized. When the Game Boy is turned
on, sound is enabled by default, and must be turned off manually when
not used.</p> <h2 id="not-using-cgb-double-speed-mode"><a href="#not-using-cgb-double-speed-mode" class="header-anchor">#</a> Not using CGB Double Speed Mode</h2> <p>Because CGB Double Speed mode consumes more power, it's recommended to
use normal speed when possible. There's limited ability to switch
between both speeds, for example, a game might use normal speed in the
title screen, and double speed in the game, or vice versa. However,
during speed switch, the display collapses for a short moment, so it's
not a good idea to alter speeds within active game or title screen
periods.</p> <h2 id="using-the-skills"><a href="#using-the-skills" class="header-anchor">#</a> Using the Skills</h2> <p>Most of the above power saving methods will produce best results when
using efficient and tight assembler code which requires as little CPU
power as possible. Using a high level language will require more CPU
power and these techniques will not have as big as an effect.</p> <p>To optimize your code, it might be a good idea to look at <a href="http://wikiti.brandonw.net/index.php?title=Z80_Optimization" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this

to OAM RAM if the following commands are used while their 16-bit content
is in the range of $FE00 to $FEFF while the PPU is in mode 2:</p> <div class="language- extra-class"><pre class="language-text"><code> inc rr        dec rr          ;rr = bc,de, or hl

running monochrome software.</p> <h2 id="accurate-description"><a href="#accurate-description" class="header-anchor">#</a> Accurate Description</h2> <p>The Sprite RAM Bug (or OAM Bug) actually consists of two different bugs:</p> <ul><li>Attempting to read or write from OAM (Including the $FFA0-$FEFF
region) while the PPU is in mode 2 (OAM mode) will corrupt it.</li> <li>Performing an increase or decrease operation on any 16-bit register
(BC, DE, HL, SP or PC) while that register is in the OAM range
($FE00 - $FEFF) will trigger a memory write to OAM, causing a
corruption.</li></ul> <h2 id="affected-operations"><a href="#affected-operations" class="header-anchor">#</a> Affected Operations</h2> <p>The following operations are affected by this bug:</p> <ul><li>Any memory access instruction, if it accesses OAM</li> <li><code>inc rr</code>, <code>dec rr</code> - if <code>rr</code> is a 16-bit register pointing to OAM,
it will trigger a write and corrupt OAM</li> <li><code>ldi [hl], a</code>, <code>ldd [hl], a</code>, <code>ldi a, [hl]</code>, <code>ldd a, [hl]</code>- these
will trigger a corruption twice if <code>hl</code> points to OAM; once for the
usual memory access, and once for the extra write trigger by the
inc/dec</li> <li><code>pop rr</code>, the <code>ret</code> family - For some reason, pop will trigger the
bug only 3 times (instead of the expected 4 times); one read, one
glitched write, and another read without a glitched write. This also
applies to the ret instructions.</li> <li><code>push rr</code>, the <code>call</code> family, <code>rst xx</code> and interrupt handling -
Pushing to the stack will trigger the bug 4 times; two usual writes
and two glitched write caused by the decrease. However, since one
glitched write occur in the same cycle as a actual write, this will
effectively behave like 3 writes.</li> <li>Executing code from OAM - If PC is inside OAM (executing FF,
that is, <code>rst $38</code>) the bug will trigger twice, once for increasing PC
inside OAM (triggering a write), and once for reading from OAM. If a
multi-byte opcode is executed from $FDFF or $FDFE, and bug will
similarly trigger twice for every read from OAM.</li></ul> <h2 id="corruption-patterns"><a href="#corruption-patterns" class="header-anchor">#</a> Corruption Patterns</h2> <p>The OAM is split into 20 rows of 8 bytes each, and during mode 2 the PPU
reads those rows consecutively; one every 1 M-cycle. The operations
patterns rely on type of operation (read/write/both) used on OAM during
that M-cycle, as well as the row currently accessed by the PPU. The
actual read/write address used, or the written value have no effect.
Additionally, keep in mind that OAM uses a 16-bit data bus, so all
operations are on 16-bit words.</p> <h3 id="write-corruption"><a href="#write-corruption" class="header-anchor">#</a> Write Corruption</h3> <p>A write corruption corrupts the currently access row in the following
manner, as long as it's not the first row (containing the first two
sprites):</p> <ul><li>The first word in the row is replaced with this bitwise expression:
<code>((a ^ c) &amp; (b ^ c)) ^ c</code>, where <code>a</code> is the original value of that
word, <code>b</code> is the first word in the preceding row, and <code>c</code> is the
third word in the preceding row.</li> <li>The last three words are copied from the last three words in the
preceding row.</li></ul> <h3 id="read-corruption"><a href="#read-corruption" class="header-anchor">#</a> Read Corruption</h3> <p>A read corruption works similarly to a write corruption, except the
bitwise expression is <code>b | (a &amp; c)</code>.</p> <h3 id="write-during-increase-decrease"><a href="#write-during-increase-decrease" class="header-anchor">#</a> Write During Increase/Decrease</h3> <p>If a register is increased or decreased in the same M-cycle of a write,
this will effectively trigger two writes in a single M-cycle. However,
this case behaves just like a single write.</p> <h3 id="read-during-increase-decrease"><a href="#read-during-increase-decrease" class="header-anchor">#</a> Read During Increase/Decrease</h3> <p>If a register is increased or decreased in the same M-cycle of a write,

M-cycle, resulting in a more complex corruption pattern:</p> <ul><li>This corruption will not happen if the accessed row is one of the
first four, as well as if it's the last row:
<ul><li>The first word in the row preceding the currently accessed row
is replaced with the following bitwise expression:
<code>(b &amp; (a | c | d)) | (a &amp; c &amp; d)</code> where <code>a</code> is the first word
two rows before the currently accessed row, <code>b</code> is the first
word in the preceding row (the word being corrupted), <code>c</code> is the
first word in the currently accessed row, and <code>d</code> is the third
word in the preceding row.</li> <li>The contents of the preceding row is copied (after the
corruption of the first word in it) both to the currently
accessed row and to two rows before the currently accessed row</li></ul></li> <li>Regardless of wether the previous corruption occurred or not, a

games, with one 4-color palette for backgrounds and two 3-color
palettes for sprites.  Because of past underuse of Super Game Boy
features even in first-party games (as explained in an article by
Christine Love), Nintendo required Game Boy Color games to appear
more colorful than this automatic colorization.  Thus Nintendo
required publishers to keep Nintendo in the loop at three points in
development.  The Mario Club division evaluated games on whether
color was being used appropriately.  Some things Mario Club looked at
were variety of colors, both within a scene and between scenes; choice
of colors appropriate to a game's art style, such as objects being
distinguishable and trees being colored like trees; and contrast
between foreground and background to emphasize color saturation.</p> <p>For both original and ported games, the initial written game design
document needed to explain and illustrate how color would be used, as
well as a project schedule, estimated ROM and RAM size, and whether
the ROM was dual compatible or GBC-only.  Ports of a monochrome game
(such as <em>Tetris DX</em>, <em>Link's Awakening DX</em>, or ICOM's <em>MacVenture</em>
series) to Game Boy Color were subject to concept pre-approval,
unlike original games.  A port's proposal needed to explain what new
gameplay content (other than just colorization) it would include,
such as levels, characters, or items.</p> <p>At 50 percent milestone and near completion, the publisher would
submit a ROM image to Mario Club for feedback on use of color and
other aspects of game design.</p> <h3 id="references"><a href="#references" class="header-anchor">#</a> References</h3> <ul><li><a href="https://github.com/AntonioND/giibiiadvance/tree/master/docs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Antonio Niño Díaz - The Cycle-Accurate Game Boy Docs<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg></a></li> <li><a href="https://github.com/AntonioND/gbcam-rev-engineer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Antonio Niño Díaz - Game Boy Camera RE<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg></a></li> <li><a href="http://www.its.caltech.edu/~costis/sgb_hack/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Costis Sideris.
