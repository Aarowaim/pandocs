Overview
--------

MBC5 (Memory Bank Controller 5) is the 4th generation MBC. There
apparently was no MBC4, presumably because of the superstition about the
number 4 in Japanese culture. It is the first MBC that is guranteed to
work properly with [GBC](CGB-001 "wikilink") [double speed
mode](CGB_Registers#FF4D_-_KEY1_-_CGB_Mode_Only_-_Prepare_Speed_Switch "wikilink").
It can map up to 64 Mbits (8 MBytes) of ROM.
