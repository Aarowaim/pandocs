Pan Docs Wikification
---------------------

### Mission

Pan Docs is the most comprehensive technical reference to Gameboy that
is available to the public. It was originally written by Pan of Anthrox,
and was later maintained by Martin Korth, also known for
[no\$gmb](no$gmb "wikilink"). As Pandocs is an important resource, it is
a priority to add it to the wiki.

The addition of information from the document is done under the
following premises:

-   It is thought that the information in the document was meant to be
    public domain by its authors.
-   The document is no longer actively maintained by its original
    authors.
-   Adding the information to a wiki allows people to correct or add
    information if needed.
-   That the information can be presented in such a way that it is more
    appealing.

### Ways to help

-   Add information from Pan Docs. (To do: Formatting guidelines)
-   Convert ASCII art into images or tables, or other formatting as
    appropriate.
-   Condense information! Create a parallel article where the most
    important parts of a Pandocs article are condensed.
