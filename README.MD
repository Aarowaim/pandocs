# Pan Docs

> The single, most comprehensive technical reference to Gameboy that is available to the public.

### History

Pan Docs - also known as `GAMEBOY.TXT` or `GBSPEC.TXT` - is an old document dating back to 1995 originally written by Pan of Anthrox, revised, edited and updated by many others during these years.

In 2008, a wikified version (using Martin Korth's 2001 revision as baseline) has been published. The document has been split in different articles and it continued being mantained and updated in that form.

In 2020, we want to make this repository the new home of this resource, where it can receive public discussion and contributions, while mantaining its legacy and historical relevance.

In the [historical](historical/) folder you will find every version we could find, starting from the (supposedly) 1995 original version.

### Contributing 

[This]() is  RFC proposing the change. You're welcome to discuss the development of this project on the [gbdev Discord chat]() or on IRC (EFNET `#gbdev`, `gbdev2`).
